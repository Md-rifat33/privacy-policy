    <h4 class="sub_title">California Online Privacy Protection Act</h4>
    <p class="description">
      CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial
      websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach
      stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the
      United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites
      collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers
      to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the
      information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom
      it is being shared. - See more at:
      http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf
    </p>
    <h4 class="sub_title">According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</h4>
    <p class="description">
      Users can visit our site anonymously. <br />
      Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home
      page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our
      website. <br />
      Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be
      found on the page specified above.
    </p>
    <p class="description">

    </h4>
    <p class="description">
      It's also important to note that we allow third-party behavioral tracking
    </p>
    <h4 class="sub_title">COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h4>
    <p class="description">
      When it comes to the collection of personal information from children
      under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection
      Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United
      States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells
      out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect
      children's privacy and safety online.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.
      <br />
      Do we let third-parties, including ad networks or plug-ins collect PII
      from children under 13?
    </p>
    <h4 class="sub_title">Fair Information Practices</h4>
    <p class="description">
      The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law
      in the United States and the concepts they include have played a
      significant role in the development of data protection laws around the
      globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they
      should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy laws
      that protect personal information.
    </p>
    <h4 class="sub_title">
      In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the
      following responsive action, should a data breach occur:
    </h4>
    <p class="description">We will notify you via email</p>
    <ul class="unordered_list">
      <li class="list_item">Within 7 business days</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="description">We will notify the users via in-site notification</p>
    <ul class="unordered_list">
      <li class="list_item">Within 7 business days</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="description">
      We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that
      individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against
      data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This
      principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights
      against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or
      government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data
      processors.
    </p>
    <h4 class="sub_title">CAN SPAM Act</h4>
    <p class="description">
      The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email,
      establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the
      right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough
      penalties for violations.
    </p>
    <h4 class="sub_title">We collect your email address in order to:</h4>
